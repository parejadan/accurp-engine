#Accurp-Engine

Overview
--------
As a class project for our AI-2 course, we took a machine learning approach in evaluating translation applications. By doing this we aim to create some insight on these apps performance. This project was a joint collaboration with students at Oregon U, who wrapped a GUI and server around our "engine".

The prezi [here](http://prezi.com/5jyx6zxrikwz/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) can provide in depth description of the repo's functionality. 

* Machine Learning models are located within the predictors.py file, useful tools are located inside the engine.py file.
* Future updates will include more classifiers.
